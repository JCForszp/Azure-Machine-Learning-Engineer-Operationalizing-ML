# Machine Learning Engineer With Microsoft Azure Nanodegree Program / Project 2: operationalizing Machine Learning

this project applies two different processings available on Azure Machine Learning Studio, both related to the same dataset (a bank marketing data that can be retrieved [here](https://automlsamplenotebookdata.blob.core.windows.net/automl-sample-notebook-data/bankmarketing_train.csv). 
The first processing, that will be demoed in the first section of this document, consists in identifying the best prediction model, deploying it in Azure and consuming it from a local python script. 
The second processing consists in the setup of a complete pipeline totally driven by the Azure Python SDK. The corresponding Jupyter notebook (with the details of the execution steps) can be found in the starter files folder, shortcut [here](https://github.com/JCForszp/nd00333_AZMLND_C2/blob/master/starter_files/aml-pipelines-with-automated-machine-learning-step.ipynb) ).

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screencasts required to demonstrate key steps. 

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:
